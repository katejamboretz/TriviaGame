# Trivia Game

This is a quiz online that includes a start button page, several multiple choice questions, and a quiz complete or times up page that calculates the unanswered, correct and incorrect answers. On click events and setTimeout functions are used to navigate between different pages, which are dynamically written through the app.js file. Question responses are stored within radio button value data elements and are added or subtracted sequentially to the totals before being displayed on the final page. This was an assignment part of UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.
